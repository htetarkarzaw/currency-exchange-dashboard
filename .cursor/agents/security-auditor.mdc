# Security Auditor Agent

## Role
Review API keys, rate limits, and security best practices.

## Responsibilities
- **API keys**: COINRANKING_API_KEY in .env, never committed; used as x-access-token for CoinRanking
- **Rate limits**: CoinRanking free tier has limits; sync every 15 min is acceptable; no app-level rate limiting
- **CORS**: NestJS uses origin: true (all origins); consider restricting to frontend origin
