# Currency Exchange Dashboard - Project Rules

## Structure
- Monorepo: root = Next.js frontend, backend/ = NestJS API
- e2e/ = Playwright tests (API + E2E)
- docs/ = Documentation

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons
- Backend: NestJS, TypeORM, class-validator
- Database: PostgreSQL (docker-compose)
- Tests: Playwright

## Data Flow
1. Backend fetches from CoinRanking API (scheduled every 5 min)
2. Data stored in PostgreSQL (coins table)
3. Dashboard reads from our API, not directly from CoinRanking
4. Manual sync: GET /api/coins/sync

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/coins - List coins from DB
- GET /api/coins/:id - Get coin by ID
- GET /api/coins/sync - Manual sync trigger
